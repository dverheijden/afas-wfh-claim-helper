# Working From Home - AFAS claim helper

Helper website for claiming Work From Home allowance, which can be found [here](https://dverheijden.github.io/afas-wfh-claim-helper/).

The current process is quite verbose and cumbersome to fill out (especially given the format of the "days" field).
As such, I created a quick tool for my dev-day to make it easier to claim your WFH allowance using AFAS.

The only thing you have to do is open the GitHub pages website, fill in your WFH days and copy the information.

## Run locally

First, you'll need to install the dependencies:

```shell
yarn install --dev
```

For running a development build, you can just run:

```shell
yarn start
```
